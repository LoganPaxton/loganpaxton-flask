    <h1>Logan's Site</h1>
    <p>Yes, I'm back with the 3rd revision of my site. It has taken a total of 4 hours, 3 different coding languages / frameworks, and 3 domains to get here. But in the end, I did it.</p>
    <p>Now, you remeber on the first revision how I said there was a blog coming soon? Well, it is really coming soon now, as I have switched over to the Flask framework (which I am much more experienced in). Soon, it will be avaiable at this line <a href="/blog">loganpaxton.foo.ng/blog</a></p>

    <h2>Quick Links</h3>
    <p>Coming soon!</p>
